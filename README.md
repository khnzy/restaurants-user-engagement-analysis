Problem Statement
In a competitive market like the restaurant industry, understanding the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders. Utilizing the Yelp dataset, this project aims to investigate the relationship
between user engagement (reviews, tips, and check-ins) and business success metrics (review count, ratings) for restaurants.

Recommendations
Utilizing insights from the analysis of various metrics such as user engagement, sentiment of reviews,peak hours, and the impact of elite users, businesses can make informed decisions to drive success.
Collaborating with elite users and leveraging their influence can amplify promotional efforts, increase brand awareness, and drive customer acquisition.
Businesses can adjust their operating hours or introduce special promotions to capitalize on the increased demand during peak hours.
Less successful businesses may need to focus on strategies to enhance user engagement over time, such as improving service quality, responding to customer feedback.
Cities with high success scores presents opportunities for restaurant chains to expand or invest further.
